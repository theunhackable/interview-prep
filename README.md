# Striver's A2Z DSA Course - Daily Study Plan

This README outlines a daily study plan for completing Striver's A2Z DSA course, starting **June 2nd, 2025**. The plan allocates **2 hours per day** and emphasizes conceptual understanding alongside problem-solving.

---

## General Daily Approach (2-Hour Slot)

- **30-45 minutes: Concept Review**
  - [x] Watch Striver's videos, review notes, and understand the core theory for the day's topic.
  - [ ] Adjust time if you're new to a concept.
- **1 hour - 1 hour 15 minutes: Problem Solving**
  - [ ] Aim for **2-3 easy/medium problems** or **1-2 hard problems**.
  - [ ] If stuck, try for **15-20 minutes** before looking at solutions.
- **15 minutes: Review & Reflection**
  - [ ] Briefly review solved problems, consider edge cases, and note any questions.

---

## Important Guidelines

- [ ] **Be Flexible:** This is a guide. Adjust based on your progress and problem difficulty.
- [ ] **Quality Over Quantity:** Focus on deep understanding rather than just rushing through problems.
- [ ] **Prevent Burnout:** Take breaks if needed. Consistency is key.
- [ ] **Regular Revision:** Regularly revisit older topics and problems.
- [ ] **Utilize Resources:** Leverage Striver's videos, official problem links (LeetCode/GFG), and any provided course materials.
- [ ] **Practice Mock Interviews/Contests:** Integrate these as you advance to simulate real-world scenarios.
